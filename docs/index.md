Welcome to Tactical Triggernometry's Admin Documentation!  Navigation is split into four general sections:

|Section|Description|
|-------|---------- |
|`Server`| Contains Server rules and a "faster-to-consume rules refresher| 
|`Admin Policies`| What you should and shouldn't do as an admin on the TT server and Discord|
|`Guides`| Conventional wisdom we use at TT to keep the server thriving|
|`Reference`| In case you just need to look something up|

Also, please note that this documentation is searchable using the magnifying class at the top of the page.
